# React Context API Demo

This project demonstrates React's Context API for state management through a simple counter application.

## Key Concepts

- **Context Creation**: Shows how to create a shared state container
- **Provider Pattern**: Demonstrates wrapping components to provide state
- **State Consumption**: Illustrates accessing state from any child component
- **Counter Functionality**:
  - Increment button that increases the count
  - Decrement button that decreases the count
  - Live display of current count value

## Implementation Approach

The project uses three main architectural patterns:
1. A central Context that holds the shared state
2. A Provider component that manages and distributes the state
3. Multiple Consumer components that access and modify the state

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`
2. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
3. Open your browser to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
